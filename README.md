# Advent of Code 2020
This repository features solutions to the 2020 **Advent of Code** hosted on https://adventofcode.com/2020/about.

## About
For my third year doing Advent of Code, I chose to implement my solutions using the **C#** programming language.

Although many people focus on the competitive aspect of Advent of Code, coding up a solution as fast as possible, I use the problems to explore code design and execution efficiency. All of my solutions must run in less than one second. This is a very gracious limit, but it rules out many brute force algorithms. The only exception to this rule is Day 15, Part B because there is no possible optimization to decrease the runtime opposed to using a more efficient programming language or better hardware.
